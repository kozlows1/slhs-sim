SLHS-VID
=========

Speech therapy examination simulation for the Department of Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences (SLHS) at Purdue University.

##Project Need

SLHS students need practice in administering these examinations, however, the process of gathering and scheduling examinations with patients can be time consuming for professors. These simulations will allow students to practice the administration of these examinations without the overhead of scheduling an appointment. This will also free up time for instructors to spend more time working with students.
