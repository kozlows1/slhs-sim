                    <p><strong>What is our project about?</strong>: We are an EPICS program
	                students of 4 at Purdue EPICS program involved in creating a webpage that trains  
                    SLHS students to become a test proctor for PPVT-IV testing service.</p>

	                English vocabulary skills.</p>
	                <p><strong>What is our purpose?</strong>: By providing 
	                a learning web-paged program for SLHS students, we believe that we can train 
	                students to become test proctor for students who needs to be evaluated. This would significantly reduce the amount of time necessary to train each student. This program would at student's pace and does not require for student to be on site. All you need is you and your computer. </p>
