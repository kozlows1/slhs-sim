                    &nbsp<p><strong>Story about our project</strong>: Anyone in life at one point can have difficulty communicating with people. <br />
                        This may include children, adults, who are experiencing difficulties in expressing their ideas or feelings. 
                        When they do, many institutes around the states try to evaluate the capabilites of an individual through a testing method.
                        Our project will effectively train a SLHS student, so that he or she can proctor the examination.
